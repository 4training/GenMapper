# Genmapper
Visualizing church health for house churches: From one church to networks with generations of churches.

We'll use dart/flutter. First step is to create a web app out of this, later we want to have native Android and iOS apps as well.

## License
Jesus says in Matthew 10:8, “Freely you have received; freely give.”
We follow His example and believe His principles are well expressed in the developer world through free and open-source software.
That's why we want you to have the ["four freedoms"](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/) to freely use, study, share and improve this software.
We only require you to release any derived work under the same conditions (you're not allowed to take this code, build upon it and make the result proprietary):

[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE) with [Apple app store exception](COPYING.iOS)

The AGPL is essentially the same as the GPL with one additional paragraph allowing users who interact with the software over a network to receive the source for that program.
This is relevant for any web application (as this will also be) where the way of software distribution is different than what was normal back when the GNU Public License was created.
The GPL wasn't aware of this form of distribution which is now so common. The AGPL fixes this "web services loophole".

Thanks to the people from the Nextcloud iOS app to [find and explain a solution](https://nextcloud.com/it/blog/nextcloud-ios-app-open-sourced/) to the restrictive policies of the Apple App Store which are not fully compatible with the GNU Public licenses.

## Contributing
By contributing you release your contributed code under the licensing terms explained above. Thank you!
